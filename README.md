# Game Name
This is the source code of the game 'Game Name', submitted for the Game Off 2025 game jam hosted by GitHub in itch.io on November 2025. The theme of the jam is 'Waves'.

## Game Idea
You play as a robot, inspired by the Star Wars droid BB-8, searching for Green Life in a space vessel. You access terminal to hack doors, pistons, contraptions, and other droids.

## Theme Implementation
The terminal uploads code in a 'Waves'. So the droid hack works along the circumference of a "Code Circle", and any hackable element in contact with its circumference will be hacked.

### Waves Definition
Waves : A disturbance that transfers energy from one place to another without the net movement of the medium itself.
